        <h2>What challenges did Henry face?</h2>
        <p>Back in the day, the world had way less technology. On ships, there were tons of struggles with communication and navigation. As well, ships were made without all the resources we can use today, which lead to them being stuck in ice many times while far out. Arctic exploration as well was not a high priority back then, so there was often a struggle to get the needed supplies and financial support which his missions. Another big issue would be cultural barries. Henry would've had to of adjusted to living how Indigenous people would and as well learn their languages. Overall, there were many struggles that had to be overcome.</p>
